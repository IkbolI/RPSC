## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

### What I learned

I understood better to use positioning and z-index, working with SVG files, better using DOM in JS, storing data in JS.  


### Continued development

I have not finished mobile verison, since I have used wrong approach, probably. I need rethink my code and to come to the solution with Bootstrap responsive coding of web-page. 

### Useful resources

Mainly, I was using Stackoverflow, W3, MDN and Bootstrap sources for coding. I think everybody knows about them, so there is no need to mention them separately.
